# Map Title: Connectivity in the Border Zone and Vulnerable Communities - CADH

This map includes several elements:

- Provincial capitals in the border zone (white points).
- Major human settlements (pink points).
- 50 communities targeted by the CADH project for the reintegration of isolated communities (blue points).
- A raster showing the elevation (mountains) in the border region.

This map was created to analyze the socioeconomic challenges faced by the region. It highlights that connectivity is a significant issue, as the provinces, despite being geographically close, are disconnected due to mountain ranges that separate them, making communication between the north and south difficult. The map also shows isolated communities, often near these mountainous areas, which require public policy interventions.
