# Map title: Difference in years of life expectancy at birth e(0) between White and Black population in USA by state, 2001

In this map, we can see that the differences in life expectancy between the White and Black populations in the USA are more predominant in some states than others. 

Looking at this map of 2001 data showing the e(0) difference between both groups, we can see that the gap in life expectancy is not the same throughout the country. Some states in the Midwest of USA and Florida show a higher difference (more than 6 years) than the rest of the states. This finding could be related to the distribution of the black population across USA, as we saw that in the Midwest there is a relatively low concentration of black people compared to other regions. The state that shows the highest gap is the District of Columbia with a surprising 11.9 gap in life expectancy.
