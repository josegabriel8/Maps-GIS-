# GIS Maps Catalog
Welcome to the GIS Maps Catalog repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of various GIS (Geographic Information System) maps that I have created. Each map in this catalog is organized into its own directory, containing the map file and a README file that provides detailed information about the map.

## Maps included 
- Life expectancy map US STATES
- Average hospital length of stay standard rates New York counties 
- Califications map RD PROVINCES
- Rural conectivity map RD regions
- Hospitals identification RD regions
- Enviromental index ITALY provinces
  

## How to Use
To explore a specific map:

Browse the repository and click on the directory of the map you're interested in.
Open the README.md file within that directory to read more about the map and its context.
View the map.png file to see the visual representation of the map.
