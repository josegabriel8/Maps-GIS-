# Map Title: New York State Counties - Average Standard Rates for Hospital Length of Stay Greater Than 8 Days, 2019

This map illustrates the geographical variation in hospital length of stay (LOS) greater than 8 days (LOS8) across New York State counties in 2019. The map was created using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and official state shapefiles to visually analyze and interpret these variations.
The visualization reveals distinct patterns, particularly in the southern region of New York State, where counties such as Long Island show higher LOS8 rates. The highest LOS8 rates (greater than 1.6) were observed in counties including Suffolk, Queens, Kings, Bronx, Manhattan, Richmond, Nassau, Rockland, Westchester, Monroe, and Erie. These findings suggest a possible link between higher population density and prolonged hospital stays.
