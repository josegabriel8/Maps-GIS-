# Map Title: Density of Healthcare Centers in Border Regions, 2018

This map displays the availability of primary and secondary healthcare centers in the border regions of the Dominican Republic, contrasted with the concentration of socioeconomically vulnerable populations in each municipal district (darker blue indicates a higher concentration of vulnerable individuals).
The map was utilized in an analysis conducted by the Ministry of Economy to assess the availability of healthcare centers. The goal was to identify areas with a shortage of healthcare centers where there was a high concentration of vulnerable populations. This situation was particularly evident in the southern regions, such as Pedernales and parts of Baoruco, where there was a low density of healthcare centers despite a large vulnerable population.
